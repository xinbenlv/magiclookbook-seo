# What to Wear to a Funeral: Respectful and Appropriate Attire Guide

Attending a funeral requires careful consideration of your outfit. The goal is to show respect while maintaining dignity and supporting the grieving family through appropriate dress choices.

## Traditional Funeral Attire

**The Classic Black Ensemble**
Black remains the most traditional and safe choice for funeral attire. It symbolizes mourning and respect across many cultures. However, modern etiquette also accepts other dark, muted colors.

**Men's Funeral Dress Code**
Men should wear dark suits with conservative ties. Avoid bright colors or flashy patterns. A simple black or navy tie with a white or light blue shirt is appropriate.
