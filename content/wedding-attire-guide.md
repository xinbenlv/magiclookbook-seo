# What to Wear to a Wedding: Complete Style Guide for Different Wedding Styles

Planning your wedding guest attire can be tricky. Whether it's a beach ceremony or black-tie evening affair, knowing what to wear ensures you look appropriate while celebrating the happy couple.

## Different Wedding Styles Require Different Outfits

**Garden/Outdoor Weddings**
For outdoor ceremonies, opt for breathable fabrics and comfortable shoes. Avoid stilettos that might sink into grass. Light colors and floral patterns work beautifully against natural backdrops.

**Evening/Formal Weddings**
Black-tie or cocktail attire calls for elevated looks. Men should wear dark suits or tuxedos, while women can choose elegant dresses or sophisticated separates.

## Color Coordination and Etiquette

Always avoid white, ivory, or anything that might upstage the bride. Navy, burgundy, and jewel tones are excellent choices. Consider the season and venue when selecting your palette.
